PropOps Community Manager Information Assistant: Complete PRD and Implementation Guide
PropOps is positioned to transform mobile home park management through an intelligent information assistant. This comprehensive guide provides everything needed to build, deploy, and maintain a community manager knowledge base system using OpenAI's API, with primary focus on instant access to policies, procedures, and community information.
Tech stack for simple, effective deployment
The research reveals a clear technology path that balances simplicity with scalability. For frontend development, React with CopilotKit emerges as the optimal choice, providing pre-built AI components like <CopilotPopup /> and <CopilotSidebar /> that dramatically reduce development time. Minchatdev This pairs perfectly with Node.js + Express on the backend, leveraging the official OpenAI SDK v4 for seamless integration. FastAPI
For data persistence, SQLite offers zero-configuration simplicity during development and can handle production loads up to 10,000 users. When scaling becomes necessary, PostgreSQL provides a smooth migration path with added benefits like vector extensions for semantic search capabilities. The database schema remains straightforward:
sqlCREATE TABLE conversations (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
user_id TEXT,
message TEXT,
role TEXT, -- 'user' or 'assistant'
timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Deployment should start with Vercel for the frontend (free tier sufficient for MVPs) and Railway for the backend ($5-20/month), providing automatic deployments and built-in monitoring. This stack delivers production-ready infrastructure for under $30/month during early stages.
Conversational AI patterns that work
Research from Nielsen Norman Group and Google's conversation design principles shows that successful chatbots follow linear flows with limited branching. Complex decision trees confuse users; instead, guide them through clear, sequential steps. Nielsen Norman Group +2 For PropOps, this means structuring interactions like:
Tenant: "I need maintenance help"
AI: "I'll help you create a maintenance request. What issue are you experiencing?"
Tenant: "My water heater isn't working"
AI: "I understand your water heater isn't working. Is there any water leaking?
This helps me determine urgency."
[Continue linear flow to resolution]
The three-strike error handling system proves most effective: first attempt asks for clarification, second provides alternatives, third escalates to human support. PromptLayernngroup This prevents frustration while maintaining automation efficiency.
For UI implementation, open-source libraries like ChatScope (React) provide production-ready components including message lists, typing indicators, and rich media support. GitHubCometChat Mobile-first design is critical—position input fields at screen bottom for 40% faster response times on mobile devices. Bricxlabs

Critical property management features
Research identifies seven essential capabilities for property management AI, with mobile home parks requiring additional specialized features: Swiftlane
Universal property management needs:

24/7 tenant communication EliseAI +2 - Studies show 69% query resolution without human intervention LethubSwiftlane
Maintenance request management Voiceflow - Natural language to structured tickets with urgency classification
Rent payment assistance - Balance inquiries, payment methods, reminder scheduling
Lease information access - Document retrieval and plain-language explanations
Community rules clarification - Policy lookup and violation prevention
Emergency response protocols - Immediate escalation with human handoff
Availability inquiries - Real-time vacancy information and tour scheduling

Mobile home park specifics:

Lot rent versus home ownership billing separation
Home transfer approval workflows with background check integration
Utility allocation for master-metered communities doorloop
Visitor registration and overnight guest policies

Industry data shows 75% of property management companies achieve ROI within 12 months through AI automation, with 15-20 hours weekly time savings per property manager. LethubVoiceflow
Security architecture for OpenAI integration
Security must be foundational, not an afterthought. Recent incidents show 84% of organizations experienced API security breaches in 2024, Akamai making robust protection critical.
API Key Management:
python# NEVER expose keys client-side
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") # Stored in environment
)

# Implement key rotation every 30-90 days

# Use separate keys for dev/staging/production

# Monitor usage patterns for anomalies

Prompt Injection Prevention:
pythondef sanitize_input(user_input):
dangerous_patterns = [
r'ignore.*previous.*instructions',
r'system.*prompt',
r'<\|im_start\|>',
]
for pattern in dangerous_patterns:
user_input = re.sub(pattern, '', user_input, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
return user_input.strip()
Cost Control Architecture:

Set spending thresholds at 90% and 95% with email alerts
Implement client-side rate limiting (60 requests/minute)
Use GPT-4o-mini for 85% of queries (11% of GPT-4o cost)
Cache common responses with 1-hour TTL
Batch non-urgent requests for 50% savings

Compliance Requirements:

Execute OpenAI's Data Processing Agreement
Implement 30-day conversation retention with user consent
Enable GDPR/CCPA data subject rights
Maintain audit logs for fair housing compliance ZuploOpenAI

User interface patterns for conversational AI
The interface must prioritize clarity and accessibility while maintaining professional standards appropriate for property management. microsoft
Core UI Components:

Message bubbles with sender identification
Typing indicators updating every 2 seconds Bricxlabs
Quick reply buttons (maximum 5 options) Bricxlabs
File upload for maintenance photos
Status indicators (sent, delivered, read)

Mobile-First Design Requirements:

Single-column layout on screens <768px
Touch targets minimum 44x44px
Bottom-positioned input field Bricxlabs
Swipe gestures for conversation navigation
Progressive Web App capabilities AI SDK

Conversation Flow Best Practices:
javascript// Example interaction structure
const maintenanceFlow = {
initial: "I'll help you create a maintenance request. What issue are you experiencing?",
clarification: "Can you provide more details about [issue]?",
urgency: "Is this issue causing immediate safety concerns or property damage?",
confirmation: "I've created a [priority] maintenance request for [issue]. Our team will contact you within [timeframe].",
handoff: "This seems like an emergency. I'm connecting you with our on-call team immediately."
};
Development workflow recommendations
For Solo Developers:

Use VS Code with GitHub Copilot for AI-assisted development
Docker Compose for consistent local environment
Feature branches with descriptive commits
Automated testing for conversation flows

Testing Strategy for AI Applications:
javascriptdescribe('Conversation Context', () => {
test('maintains context across messages', async () => {
const conversation = new ConversationManager();
await conversation.addMessage('user', 'My name is John');
await conversation.addMessage('assistant', 'Nice to meet you, John!');

    const response = await conversation.sendMessage('What is my name?');
    expect(response).toContain('John');

});
});
Version Control for Prompts:
Implement semantic versioning for all prompts:

Format: {feature}-{purpose}-v{major}.{minor}.{patch}
Example: maintenance-request-intake-v1.2.0
Track performance metrics for each version
Maintain rollback capabilities Latitude Blog
